## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Build the Docker image:
    
```bash
docker build -t gpt3-text-generation .
``` 

3. Run the Docker container, providing your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
```bash
docker run -e API_KEY=your_api_key -it gpt3-text-generation
```

## How it Works

The project consists of a Python script that uses the OpenAI API to generate text based on a prompt. The script is packaged in a Docker container with all its dependencies, making it easy to run on any system that has Docker installed.

The API key is passed to the script as an environment variable when the Docker container is run. This allows you to keep your API key secure and separate from your code.

## Conclusion

This project provides a simple and convenient way to generate text using OpenAI's GPT-3. With its Docker-based setup, you can quickly and easily generate text from any system with Docker installed. Whether you're a developer looking to integrate GPT-3 into your project, or just someone looking to play around with this incredible technology, this project has you covered!
